## 🚀 Key Features

### 👻 Stealth Mode (Ghost Protocol)

Concerned about privacy during online meetings or streaming?

* **Invisible to Recorders:** Seeya utilizes advanced window affinity technology to remain completely invisible to screen capture software like **Google Meet, Teams, Zoom, Discord, AnyDesk, and OBS**.
* **Visible to You:** While hidden from others, the interface remains fully accessible to you. Your secret assistant stays secret.

### 🧠 True Offline Privacy

* **Ideal Use:** Perfect for sensitive work environments where data security is paramount.
